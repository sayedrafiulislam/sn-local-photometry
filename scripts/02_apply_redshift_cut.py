02_apply_redshift_cut.py

Purpose
-------
Splits the NED-queried catalog (output of 01_build_catalog.py) into:

  (1) sn_catalog_final.csv   -- objects with a resolved redshift; this is
      the working sample for all downstream steps (PSF measurement,
      aperture photometry, curve-of-growth analysis).

  (2) excluded_objects_log.csv -- objects with no resolved redshift, kept
      as an explicit, auditable record of what was excluded and why,
      rather than silently dropping them. This file is what the
      methods-section selection-cut statement (Table 2-style) is drawn
      from, and it is what would let a future student pick this sample
      back up and resolve the stragglers via a CSP-II target list or TNS.

Usage
-----
    python 02_apply_redshift_cut.py --in-csv results\\sn_catalog_v2.csv --out-dir results\\
